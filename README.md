```

Activate the virtual env.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Start the game
```
python run_game.py
```

## Style

For style we use `black` a tool to auto format the code, use it with:
```
black .
```

We also sort import with `isort`:
```
isort .
```

You can run black after isort in some case the output differ.
